# Image-based Product Recommender System

In this project, we capture visual features from IKEA's product images, which are then processed to retain essential information while reducing dimensional constraints. Following this, we employ a highly effective clustering algorithm, selected after a comparative analysis of accuracy across different methods, to group products based on image similarity. This system, therefore, provides users with essential recommendations, making it easier for them to explore and select products that fit seamlessly into their aesthetic vision.

For IKEA, which emphasizes customer-centered design and consistent product quality, a traditional rating-based or item-based recommender system is less essential. Since customers can rely on IKEAâ€™s uniform standards, the focus naturally shifts to the visual appeal of products. 
In the furniture and design industry, where factors like aesthetics, color, shape, and texture play a crucial role, customer decisions are often guided more by the look and feel of products than by ratings or other quantitative factors.
An image-based recommender system is particularly valuable in this context, as it leverages visual cues, analyzing product images to provide suggestions based on style, color, and pattern of the products.
